import PipelineDsl

-- start at the top of the AST
-- (1) Collect the state_queues or "controllers"
-- (2) Match a state_queue/controller to an entry description
--     Tells us what variables the entry has
-- (3) Match state_queue/controller to transitions
-- (4) break up transitions at await

-- TODO: Write Objects to represent Murphi code as well
-- (5) Convert entries into records
-- (6) Convert controllers into Murphi records
--     consisting of an array of entries
-- (7) Convert transitions into Rules
--     

-- pick structure_descriptions, to get controllers


-- The error message you were getting here is not so helpful.
-- It seems that for some reason it was getting confused with the
-- (embedded) syntax declaration when opening the whole namespace, i.e.
-- it was interpreting `transition` in the DSL syntax, instead of the
-- constructor for Description. This seems to have fixed that.
